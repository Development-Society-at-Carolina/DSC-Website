# Setting Up the Angular Workspace

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed on your computer.  Check your Node version in terminal using `node -v` and npm version using `npm -v`. 
2. After cloning the repo, navigate to the app folder with `cd app`. This directory is where the angular project is stored, and likewise all the dependencies we have installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

_This step installs the Angular CLI locally. You will be able to run_ `ng` _commands in the `/DSC-Website/app` directory in the terminal using_ `npm run ng <command>`

4. If you would like to install the Angular CLI globally and be able to use `ng` commands without the `npm run` prefix, run the command `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
5. Verify Angular is installed by running the command `ng version` or `npm run ng version`.

Your workspace should now be set up to start working with Angular!

To run the development server to preview the website as you make changes to the code, execute the command `ng serve` or `npm start`.
